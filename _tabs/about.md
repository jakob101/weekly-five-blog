The goal of Weekly Five emails is to raise awareness of important technologies, be up to date with news in the industry and to try to make our life, work and code a little bit better every week. My bias is towards frontend, but I do keep track of news in all aspects of software engineering.

I started publishing Weekly Five articles because reading, improving and growing in my industry motivates me, and I wanted an external influence to keep doing it.

Archives have some content before I went public, and I don't have any Weekly Five posts before the 8th one. Those are forever forgotten.
