This week we talk about 5 topics that range various disciplines we observe in our daily work.

What does it mean for something to be simple? Is it comparable to easy? It's easy to add something complex to a project, but it's hard to remove it. How can we avoid that? Simplicity matters. I've sent¬†[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0") before. Watch it again, it's worth it.

[Android P](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17327302/android-p-update-new-features-changes-video-google-io-2018 "https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17327302/android-p-update-new-features-changes-video-google-io-2018") has lots of AI features embedded in the system. Most of them I wouldn't call AI, but it's inspirational to see how the technology we use today can do more for us.¬†Also from Google, check out [Smart Compose](https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/ "https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/")!

The inventor of Redux wrote [a gentle introduciton to Prepack](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/d85dccba72b809f56a9553972e5c33c4 "https://gist.github.com/gaearon/d85dccba72b809f56a9553972e5c33c4"), an ambitious project focused on improving performance by doing less work. It's not ready for mainstream yet, but we could be good community members and help out. Example of prepack:

(function() { var x \= 2; var y \= 2; global.answer \= x + y;})();

Outputs to:

answer \= 4;

Now, everyone loves to get stuff¬†done.¬†Low value activities keep us busy and stop us from getting real work done. Let's make time for [work that matters](https://medium.com/the-mission/want-to-improve-efficiency-stop-doing-low-value-work-41ad87e5c640 "https://medium.com/the-mission/want-to-improve-efficiency-stop-doing-low-value-work-41ad87e5c640").

If you're thinking about adopting CSS in JS, reading¬†[what's right with css-in-js](https://micahgodbolt.com/blog/what-s-right-with-css-in-js/ "https://micahgodbolt.com/blog/what-s-right-with-css-in-js/") is a great writeup from our own Micah Godbolt).
