This week we talk about 5 topics that range various disciplines we observe in our daily work.

In the video¬†[Lobe - Deep Learning made simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN69suHxS8w "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN69suHxS8w"), we see a truly great demo.¬†If the product is half as good as it looks here then they've got something really special. It outputs CoreML and TensorFlow models which you can bring into your iOS app. [Check it out](https://lobe.ai/ "https://lobe.ai/")!

I've stumbled upon a fun article, which title is [How to get your coworker to agree with you](https://www.workaguide.com/blog/2018/5/1/how-to-get-your-coworker-to-agree-with-you "https://www.workaguide.com/blog/2018/5/1/how-to-get-your-coworker-to-agree-with-you"). The fun part is because it advocates **not to**.

- [Proton Native](https://proton-native.js.org/#/ "https://proton-native.js.org/#/")¬†is an ambitious project which advertises 5 features:

- Same syntax as React Native
- Works with existing React libraries such as Redux
- Cross platform
- Native components
- Compatible with all normal (?) Node.js packages

I'm proud to show [what the Edge team has been working on](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/04/30/edgehtml-17-april-2018-update/ "https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/04/30/edgehtml-17-april-2018-update/")¬†for the new Edge April release:¬†The foundation for full-featured PWAs is now here with Service Workers and push notifications enabled by default, there‚Äôs variable fonts support, Notification API support, improved ARIA support, support for CSS transforms on SVG elements, and more.

- [This](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90169654/two-fascinating-things-salesforce-discovered-when-it-studied-color "https://www.fastcodesign.com/90169654/two-fascinating-things-salesforce-discovered-when-it-studied-color") is a¬†study which proved to be a humble reminder for the designers at Salesforce. The main takeaway being, despite thinking they knew what was best for design and performance, data should be used as a guide to make informed decisions.

The CSS gurus these days¬†are becoming [true artists](https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-francine "https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-francine").
