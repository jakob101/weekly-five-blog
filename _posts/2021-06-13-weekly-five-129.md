Welcome to Weekly Five! This week's links:

- [New Technologies WWDC 2021 | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/New-Technologies-WWDC-2021)  
  Apple created a documentation site showcasing all the technologies introduced at WWDC 2021 in a nice big list. Check it out!

- [An incomplete list of skills senior engineers need, beyond coding](https://skamille.medium.com/an-incomplete-list-of-skills-senior-engineers-need-beyond-coding-8ed4a521b29f)  
  A very succinct list. Where do you think you can improve?

- [Introducing Astro: Ship Less JavaScript](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro)  
  A new static site generator that allows you to bring your own framework (e.g. React), and it removes all JavaScript from the end product. It can download additional JavaScript when required, though.

- [How to Talk to Human Beings \[2012\]](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-talk-to-human-beings/)  
  The article recommends a book, with a quote: "the techniques in this book are so brilliant, I use them in every human interaction I can, no matter the age of the conversant."

- [Gather.town](https://gather.town/)  
  My distributed remote team has been using this app for morale events. You get an avatar in a 2d world, and coming closer to someone activates your camera and microphone. Such a genius idea!

The goal of Weekly Five emails is to raise awareness of important technologies, be up to date with news in the industry and to try to make our life, work and code a little bit better every week.
