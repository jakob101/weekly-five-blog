**A special note:**  
I recently had the privilege of having my team have a skip-level meeting with my manager, inspired by the great book [Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kick-Ass-Without-Humanity/dp/1250103509/ref=sr_1_2?hvadid=77721782230187&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=radical+candor&qid=1572858226&sr=8-2 "https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kick-Ass-Without-Humanity/dp/1250103509/ref=sr_1_2?hvadid=77721782230187&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=radical+candor&qid=1572858226&sr=8-2"). This meeting (explained in [this blog post](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/encourage-feedback/ "https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/encourage-feedback/"), tip 5), describes the reasoning behind this type of retrospective. It tries to get constructive feedback, resulting in things to **start** doing, things to **stop** doing and things to **continue** doing as a manager. It was a great experience and it goes a long way to understand how I can help my team even more. I absolutely recommend trying it out.
