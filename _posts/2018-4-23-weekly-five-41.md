This week we talk about 5 topics that range various disciplines we observe in our daily work. In the [first article](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-home), Stripe shows how they approached the design and architecture of their People directory. Stripe has been known to have ingenious designs, and this is another great piece.

We often have exciting discussions about the product I work on, LivePersonaCard, and its bundle size, code splitting, pit of success etc. [Designing very large (JavaScript) applications](https://medium.com/@cramforce/designing-very-large-javascript-applications-6e013a3291a3) is an exciting talk mentioning several patterns Google uses. This topic is hot as many of our apps and teams are becoming huge.

The W3C has moved a [new standard of authentication (WebAuthn)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/passwords-webauthn-new-web-standard-designed-replace-login-method) to what’s called the “candidate recommendation” stage – the penultimate step before it becomes an approved web standard – inviting sites and services to begin implementing it. The web standards body announced that Google, Microsoft and Mozilla had committed to supporting WebAuthn, meaning that all major web browsers short of Apple’s Safari will implement the new standard.

Zoran Todorovic shares the first article in [a series of articles about iOS 11's new framework - Core ML](https://blog.undabot.com/a-disassembly-of-machine-learning-and-core-ml-part-1-946911ea0442). This is a "getting started" for AI and machine learning, but is a very good introduction to the next one.

Are we all familiar with [Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#components), a powerful opinionated UI component framework? It's a challenge to build a UI component framework which needs to carefully define the limit of customisation every consumer can do. David Zearing proposed a series of articles called [How To Master Advanced React Design Patterns](https://itnext.io/using-advanced-design-patterns-to-create-flexible-and-reusable-react-components-part-1-dd495fa1823). In part 1, Compound components, Shaun David Hutch offers techniques he has been using recently which have completely changed his approach to creating React components.
