This week we talk about 5 topics that range various disciplines we observe in our daily work. In [Dear Developer](https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer), Charlie Owen makes a case on why we should think of our users first before jumping to the next hot framework / feature in the web dev world. This is a blog post of a talk she had given and is wonderfully in-depth and illustrated. She takes us through the history of the internet, the web, how we're repeating errors of the past, issues with the current web dev trends, why perf matters and where to go from here!

A few months ago I visited some colleagues working on Microsoft Edge, and they introduced me to a beta new linting tool, called Sonarwhal. I'm happy to share [the announcement](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/04/19/sonarwhal-v1-linting-tool-for-web/) of Sonarshal reaching v1.

Last week, the LinkedIn team presented a component-oriented [CSS authoring system](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/04/css-at-scale--linkedins-new-open-source-projects-take-on-stylesh) that compiles to high-performance stylesheets. By combining an opinionated authoring system, build-time analysis and rewriting of templates, CSS Blocks breathes new power and ease of use into the technologies and best practices that stylesheet developers already know and love.

In a GPS-heavy app like Uber, developers needed to go to extreme lengths to increase the accuracy of location data. Lots of interesting learnings [here](https://eng.uber.com/rethinking-gps/).
